## Introduction

## Single Scale Alignment

Explanation in construction!

- Search space: [-15, 15]
- Image similarity metric used: SSD (sum squared difference) of the 2 image matrices
- Cropped all image channels so that only the inner 80% of the image remains (e.g. 10% is cropped off each end of the height and width)

Below are the results for the 3 small .jpg images (cathedral, monastery, tobolsk):
